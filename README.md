# Number range project

Is project is supposed to offer a service for number range management within a application system. Number ranges can be used for every purpose where a unambiguous id is required. The service will be thread safe and will return ids via several endpoints.

## Work in progress

To develop the application use the JUnit test "NumberRangeTests.testNumberRangeInit" to initialize a number range. Then the rest endpoints can be tested.
